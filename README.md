# what this is
site to compare times of buses and trains at different stops.
## current functionality
compare two buses (bus vs bus tab)
## to be added functionality
compare two trains
compare train and bus
## current issues
- list of buses isn't as user friendly without search
- refresh is limited to one instance at a time, more efficient if both at once
- console returns fetch errors beause inputs haven't been received for all fetch requests but watch still runs on load
- deployed version on netlify will load routerview tab, but if the same page is reloaded it will display a site not found
 - this bug is probably netlify's fault tho ðŸ—¿
