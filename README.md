# What This Is
Site to compare times of buses and trains at different stops.
## Current Functionality
Compare two buses (bus vs bus tab).
## To Be Added Functionality
- compare two trains
- compare train and bus
## Current Issues
- css is mid (i won't be fixing that 😁)
- dropdowns are rendering [Object Object] instead of the placeholder and idk why
  - it isnt my ui component tho 🤷
- stops list only loads after the direction tab is clicked at least once
- console returns errors beause inputs haven't been received for all fetch requests but watch still runs on load
- deployed version on netlify will load routerview tab, but if the same page is reloaded it will display a site not found
  - this bug is probably netlify's fault tho 🗿
