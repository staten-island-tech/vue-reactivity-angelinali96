# what this is
site to compare times of buses and trains at different stops.
## current functionality
compare two buses (bus vs bus tab)
## to be added functionality
compare two trains
compare train and bus
## current issues
- directions only load if the state of the checkbox (stylized as a tab) is changed
- list of buses isn't as user friendly without search
- refresh is limited to one instance at a time, more efficient if both at once
- console returns fetch errors beause inputs haven't been received but watch still runs
