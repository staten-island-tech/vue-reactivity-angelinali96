# issues
- css is mid (i won't be fixing that 😁)
- some fetch is executed on load when it probably shouldnt
- deployed version on netlify will load routerview tab, but if the same page is reloaded it will display a site not found
  - this bug is probably netlify's fault tho this happened on another project 🗿
